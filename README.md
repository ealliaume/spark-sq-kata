# Spark SQL Kata in Scala

In this Kata you will play with Spark 2.x SQL DSL.
 
It is been split in steps, each step will allow you do play with basics functions/operation of Spark: read, count, filtering, joins, etc.

The dataset used for this kata is a list of Android Applications, it has been copied from [Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) 

## Prerequisites

1. Have SBT and Scala installed

## How does it work?

1. Clone this repository
2. Each step is described and tested in the MovieKataTest class, your goal is to make those tests green
3. If you want to cheat and see the solution, there is  git branch for that :) 

This KAta should take approximately 45 minutes, no previous Spark knowledge needed.

Good luck!
